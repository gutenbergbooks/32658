irritation compared to Charles and his "all-weather" suit!</i></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>The Standardized Man</h1>

<h2>By Stephen Bartholomew</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/t1.png" alt="T" width="45" height="50" /></div>
<p>he turbocar swiped an
embankment at ninety miles
an hour; the result was, of course,
inevitable. It was a magnificent
crash, and the driver was thrown
clear at the end of it for a distance
of 50 feet.</p>

<p>Charles looked at the body and
got his bright idea.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/t1.png" alt="T" width="45" height="50" /></div>
<p>he trouble had started a couple
of weeks before, when Edwin,
Charles' laboratory co-ordinator,
had called him into his office just
before Charles was due to leave
for home. It was a distinct breach
of etiquette to cause a worker to
arrive home at any time besides his
accustomed hour, so Charles knew
whatever Edwin wanted must be
important. He sat down opposite
the Co-ordinator and assumed a
politely questioning look.</p>

<p>"Charles, you know I wouldn't
call you here at this hour if it wasn't
important," Edwin said, pursing
his lips.</p>

<p>"Of course not, sir," Charles replied,
waiting.</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is, we
are in dire straits." Edwin stared
at the other ominously. "As you
well know, the Textile Industry,
like every other business firm in
the world, has functioned entirely
without economic troubles of any
sort for the past fifty years."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, sir...."</p>

<p>"And you are also well aware
of what would be the results of any
financial deviation in any of these
firms, particularly in a major industry
such as our own."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. Ours is a delicately
balanced economic system.
Any slight change in the economic
status of one firm would...."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Edwin leaned across
the desk and glared at him. "I have
just come from a Board of Directors
meeting. And it was made
known to us that during the past
three weeks our margin of profit
has fallen off by three tenths of a
per cent!"</p>

<p>Charles' face turned pasty white.
He swallowed and took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>"Will that information be made
public, sir?"</p>

<p>"Naturally not! But we aren't
sure just how long we can keep it
a secret! The fact of the matter
is, the IBM says that our profit
margin will continue to spiral
downward at a gradually increasing
rate unless some drastic change
occurs in our production set-up!"</p>

<p>Edwin leaned back and clasped
his hands, composing himself. "The
precise reasons for the existence of
the situation are quite obscure.
However, the IBM has informed us
that the problem can be remedied
if we make a particular change
in our production system, and it
has informed us as to the nature of
that change."</p>

<p>He stood up and placed a finger
on a capacitance switch. A panel
in the Wall slid back to reveal six
sales charts. There were two each
marked <i>Winter</i>, <i>Summer</i> and
<i>Spring-Fall</i>. Three were designated
<i>marlons</i>, and three <i>marilyns</i>. Each
of them showed a red line rising
steeply on the left, levelling out to
a perfectly straight bar all the way
across, then dipping sharply again.</p>

<p>"Look here," Edwin said. "These
are the sales charts for our six
suits. As you know, we make three
different types for marlons, and
three for marilyns. Hot-weather,
cold-weather, and medium-weather.
Each suit is designed to
last a carefully calculated length
of time, and each consumer need
only buy three suits a year. They
are exactly alike except for slight
size differences, and because of
elastic fabrics these differences are
held to a minimum. With this system
the Textile Industry attained
the ultimate in Standardization,
the ultimate in efficiency."</p>

<p>Charles rubbed his chin thoughtfully.
"Has the IBM suggested
any alternative to our system, any
possible change?"</p>

<p>Edwin sat down again, folded his
arms on the desk, and scowled.
"That's where you come in! The
IBM informs us that there is only
one possible way to stabilize our
economy, to raise our profit margin
to its former level&mdash;and that is by
further standardization!"</p>

<p>Charles raised his eyebrows.
"You mean a sexless wardrobe, sir?
That's been tried...."</p>

<p>"No, that's <i>not</i> what I mean!"
Edwin snapped. "What I mean is
an <i>all-weather suit</i>!"</p>

<p>Charles swallowed audibly at
that and said nothing.</p>

<p>"You can see the advantages, of
course," Edwin explained. "We'd
need only to manufacture two types
of suit, marlon and marilyn. Since
we'd never have to adjust our factories,
we could drop a lot of unnecessary
technicians, and with the
further standardization, manufacturing
would be faster and cheaper&mdash;a
<i>lot</i> cheaper. The consumer
would only purchase one suit a
year, but we could make up for
that by raising the prices somewhat."</p>

<p>Charles finally got a word in.
"But, <i>sir</i>! An all-weather suit?
How can we design a suit that will
be equally comfortable in the middle
of a Florida heat-wave or a
New England snowstorm?"</p>

<p>"How? <i>How?</i>" Edwin's voice
raised and his finger pointed.
"<i>You're</i> the research chemist,
Charles! You're supposed to tell
<i>me</i> how!"</p>

<p>"Sir? I...."</p>

<p>"Listen!" Edwin poked the other
in the chest. "I assume you know
what will happen to Society if the
Textile Industry becomes economically
unstable?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes sir, but...."</p>

<p>"Then I assume you realize that
the Board of Directors will stop at
nothing to preserve the status quo!
And since you happen to be our
chief industrial chemist, the entire
problem lands in your lap! Now, we
want to know how to make an all-weather
suit, and we want to know
<i>fast</i>. Therefore, Charles, you're going
to tell us how to do it! Understand?"</p>

<p>Charles nodded unhappily. "Yes
sir, I understand."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/c3.png" alt="C" width="42" height="50" /></div>
<p>harles went to work the
next day after informing his
wife that she could expect him to
begin keeping rather irregular
hours at the laboratory. The idea of
any kind of irregularity was enough
to worry any wife, and Ingrid was
the naturally suspicious type.
She was always nagging and had,
upon occasion, even gone so far as
to insinuate that Charles had individualist
tendencies.</p>

<p>So he knew that she would, embarrassingly,
call Edwin to check
up on him, but he didn't really
care.</p>

<p>The real problem was the all-weather
suit.</p>

<p>Charles put his small corps of
assistants on the project, investigating
several lines of thought at once.
Every day, someone would drop
around for a while to check on his
progress, and he had no delusions
about what would happen if he
failed. The entire economic stability
of his society depended on his
coming up with an all-weather suit,
and he began to have trouble sleeping
nights.</p>

<p>Eventually, he found what looked
like a workable solution.</p>

<p>He called Edwin to tell him
about it, and Edwin came down to
the lab to see for himself.</p>

<p>"Is <i>this</i> it?" he asked, picking up
what looked like a burlap handkerchief.</p>

<p>Charles cleared his throat. "Well,
that's the first sample, sir. Of
course, it's possible to obtain a
finer weave once we find out a few
things about it, and when it's
bleached...."</p>

<p>Edwin nodded impatiently. "Yes,
yes. Well, what's so special about
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's made of a radically
new type of fiber, sir...."</p>

<p>"How's it new?"</p>

<p>"I can show you more technical
data on it, sir, but basically the
difference between this and conventional
types of fiber is that this
is thermostatic."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, thermostatic?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, basically, the diameter
of the fiber is inversely proportional
with the temperature. When the
temperature rises, the fiber contracts,
and when the temperature
drops, it expands. So in cold weather,
you have a fine, tight weave
with good insulation, and in warm
weather you have a loose weave
with ventilation...."</p>

<p>Edwin nodded and dropped the
fabric on a lab bench. "Sounds
good."</p>

<p>"Well sir, we have to make a
few more tests on it, and it'll have
to be field tested before we can decide
if it's safe to use in garments...."</p>

<p>Edwin tapped him on the shoulder.
"Test it, Charlie."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>Edwin frowned. "We don't have
as much time as you think. We
need that suit of yours <i>fast</i>. We
can't afford to waste any more
time puttering around the laboratory.
You have the fellows downstairs
make up some of this stuff
into a Standard suit, and I want
you to put it on yourself. What I
mean is, <i>today</i>!"</p>

<p>Charles' jaw dropped. "Today!
But...."</p>

<p>"No buts! Wear it a couple of
days, and if you say it checks out,
we go into production immediately."</p>

<p>So Charles went home that
night in a new suit and a worried
frown.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/t4.png" alt="T" width="44" height="50" /></div>
<p>hings were smooth for
about two days. Charles continued
to wear the suit and Edwin
insisted on his making the preliminary
preparations for the mass-production
of thermostatic fabric.
Charles was kept busy working out
specifications.</p>

<p>Then there were two factors
that brought about a drastic change
in his life.</p>

<p>One was that he was worried.
Charles wasn't exactly sure what
he was worried about, but at the
back of his mind there was something
in the complicated molecular
structure of the new fiber that
bothered him.</p>

<p>The other factor was that Ingrid
was still nagging him. Perhaps if
Charles had been able to tell her
what he was working on she would
have understood why he was worried.
But he didn't tell her, and she
didn't understand.</p>

<p>One day after Charles had come
home and eaten, she started an
argument with him about something
or other, and in the most
heated part of the battle she had
hurled at him the supreme insult.</p>

<p>"Charles," she said, "I think you
<i>look</i> different!"</p>

<p>Coupled with the strain that
Charles was under, that had been
enough to make him stare at Ingrid
for a moment, wheel and stalk
out of the apartment.</p>

<p>After all, to say that one's face
was even subtly different&mdash;even if
it really was&mdash;was an unforgivable
insult.</p>

<p>Charles went out for a long, solitary
evening walk and ended up at
one of those places that features
six varieties of beer, a continuous
floor show and a loud band. Charles
was not quite aware of entering,
but once inside, watching the
bump-and-grinders who wore nothing
but their name tags, he found it
difficult to leave.</p>

<p>The room was just ventilated
enough to prevent suffocation, but
it was purposely kept hot and
stuffy in the hope that this would
induce thirst on the part of the
customers.</p>

<p>When he thought about it later
he decided it was undoubtedly the
humidity that had caused the catastrophe,
but when it happened
he hadn't the foggiest notion what
was going on.</p>

<p>All he knew was that he had
signalled a waitress for a third
beer, she had come threading her
way between the postage-stamp
tables, he had looked up to give
his order, she had looked down
impersonally, and then there was a
scream.</p>

<p>It took a moment to realize that
the waitress was screaming at him,
and by that time there were shouts
from the surrounding tables as well,
and men and women alike were
stumbling all over themselves to
get away from Charles.</p>

<p>In no time at all, there was a
first-rate riot in progress, then the
lights went out, and Charles had
brains enough to fight his way to
an exit and slip into the dark alley
outside.</p>

<p>And then Charles inspected himself
and realized the horrible truth.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/t4.png" alt="T" width="44" height="50" /></div>
<p>he key concept to Charles' society
was expressed in the word
<i>Standardization</i>. Standardization
had had its beginning in the early
Industrial Revolution, when men
first discovered that it was far more
efficient to make a thousand pieces
of furniture if you made them all
exactly alike.</p>

<p>And since efficiency means economic
predictability, and since predictability
means stability, Standardization
quickly became the
watchword in the world's new industrial
economy.</p>

<p>So, in time, virtually every product
manufactured was standardized.
From the smallest bolts and
screws in a wristwatch, through
automobile license plates, to clothing
styles; everything manufactured
was strictly standard equipment.</p>

<p>Of course, the only unpredictable
factor in this structure was the
human element, therefore the logical
answer was a standardized
consumer.</p>

<p>The trend had started, undoubtedly,
in Hollywood. The Art of
Cinematography had not existed
long before becoming the Motion
Picture Industry. And, naturally,
an industry must be efficient.</p>

<p>The Hollywood tycoons had decided
that the best way to reduce
the margin of risk on any new
movie star was to create an arbitrary
criterion, and to require the
potential star to measure up to that
standard.</p>

<p>Charles was absently aware that
the female standard of beauty had
been exemplified by a woman
named Marilyn, and that the masculine
standard had been represented
in someone named Marlon.</p>

<p>So, gradually, all of the new female
stars that were selected by
Hollywood resembled Marilyn as
much as possible, and male leads
were selected to look like Marlon.
If anyone had a nose that wasn't
quite right, or large ears, a little
plastic surgery quickly remedied
the problem, and if a female starlet
happened to have brown hair, peroxide
was always handy.</p>

<p>And in time, it became increasingly
difficult to tell one movie star
from another.</p>

<p>Then the standard, idealized
faces and their standards, idealized
personal mannerisms became socially
fashionable, and with modern
cosmetics and readily available
plastic surgery, the fashionable
men and women in society began to
imitate the ideal.</p>

<p>It became not only fashionable to
wear the Standard face, but indecent
<i>not</i> to do so. Social conformity
was encouraged as much as
possible, and the end result was the
closest thing to a Standardized, predictable
consumer as there ever
could be.</p>

<p>This might have produced difficult
problems, because with all
women and all men wearing identical
clothing and identical faces, it
might have become impossible to
tell one person from another, which
was not desirable even in a Standardized
world.</p>

<p>Along with the Standard face
had come name tags by which a
person might individualize himself
to the minimum necessary degree.</p>

<p>These name tags were worn
about the neck on a colorful plastic
band, with the tag itself, a white
plastic card, on the right side of the
neck. On the tag, in gold lettering,
was the person's name, address,
and Social Security number.</p>

<p>And&mdash;they were worn <i>all</i> the
time.</p>

<p>The name tag was the only
means by which a person might
be identified. Without it, anyone
might impersonate anyone else he
pleased. So, of course, it became
obscene to appear in public without
one.</p>

<p>And Charles, standing in the
alley, looked down at himself and
realized the horrible truth.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/h6.png" alt="H" width="45" height="48" /></div>
<p>e found himself running
through back streets, sidling around
corners, and darting into doorways.</p>

<p>After an hour or two, he realized
that he was no longer within the
City Limits.</p>

<p>Charles took a good look around
him and discovered he was standing
on a minor highway just outside
of town. There were no cars or
people in sight, and he dropped
off the road into some bushes to
get his wind and think.</p>

<p>He had <i>known</i> there was something
wrong with the molecular
structure of the suit he was wearing,
but Edwin wouldn't listen.</p>

<p>It had undoubtedly been the
humidity. The chemical process
had no doubt been going on since
he'd first donned the suit, but it
had been the heat in that beer
joint that had accelerated the
action enough to finish the job.
Human perspiration acting on the
new fiber in the collar of his suit
produced some obscure chemical
reaction which had a corrosive
effect on the plastic band and plastic
card of his name tag.</p>

<p>He had to get home, somehow,
and tell Edwin to hold up production
on the new thermostatic suit.
Perhaps the flaw in it could be
eliminated in a short time. If it
couldn't....</p>

<p>He considered. The world Dollar
Standard had been absolutely
stable for more years than he knew
about. What would happen if it
suddenly became unstable? A fluctuation
of even a fraction of a cent
would cause widespread panic; it
would jolt the Public's faith in its
infallible economic system. And the
panic would cause further deviation
in the Dollar's purchasing
power, and&mdash;more panic.</p>

<p>He wiped his brow. If the situation
in the Textile Industry was as
critical as Edwin said it was, then
Edwin and his superiors weren't
going to be at all happy when
Charles told them about the suit&mdash;and
Charles was going to be
the fall guy.</p>

<p>But of course he had to get back
and tell them. Because Edwin was
all set to start production on the
all-weather suit immediately, and
if he actually went through with
that and got a few million of them
onto consumer's backs, the result
would be not panic, but disaster.</p>

<p>And Charles' present problem
was how to get home without being
arrested.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i7.png" alt="I" width="29" height="50" /></div>
<p>t was then that one individual
got an extremely tough break,
and Charles got his first lucky one.</p>

<p>A turbocar came barreling down
the highway and, without warning
struck an embankment. The driver
was thrown fifty feet from the
wreckage.</p>

<p>Under different circumstances,
he would never have considered
doing what he did then. The penalty
for wearing another person's
name tag was severe. But Charles
was under an extreme emotional
strain; and without even thinking,
he bent over the limp grey form of
the other marlon and removed his
tag.</p>

<p>He straightened, then, clutching
the plastic band and looking around
at the smoking wreck. Already, he
could hear a siren somewhere in
the night.</p>

<p>He slipped the name tag over his
head and struck out through the
bushes toward the city.</p>

<p>His plan was simple; he had
another name tag in his apartment
for emergency purposes, and if
Ingrid was in bed he'd have no
trouble getting it, destroying the
one he was wearing now, and
putting on his other suit.</p>

<p>Briefly, he wondered what the
police would think of finding a
body near a smashed car with no
name tag. They'd probably decide
it was the same person that had
caused the disturbance at the night
club earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>Charles realized that the lettering
on the car had indicated it was
a public, coin-operated vehicle, so
the authorities would have no
means of identifying the body.</p>

<p>After awhile it occurred to him
that if he should go into hiding
someplace, the body might easily
be identified as his own, and he
wouldn't have to worry about what
Edwin and the other bosses would
do to him. It probably wouldn't be
noticed that the torn and blood-spattered
clothes on the corpse were
not thermostatic. But he shook his
head resolutely. Even if he were
crazy enough to try it, the body
would be reported missing by somebody
or other, so that would never
do.</p>

<p>Eventually, Charles reached a
main thoroughfare in the city and
hailed a cab. He climbed in the
back, told the driver briefly to take
him home, and then slumped down
in the seat and brooded.</p>

<p>He stared out the window, watching
the buildings go by, and the
emotional reaction of the evening
began to set in. Morbidly, Charles
wondered what they'd do to him if
he kept his mouth shut and let the
Industry put the suit into production,
and waited for the millions of
ID tags to begin to drop off.</p>

<p>The prospect was so frightening
that his apprehension over what
would happen if it was discovered
he was wearing somebody else's
tag almost disappeared.</p>

<p>Finally, the cab rolled to a
stop. Charles got out and dropped
some coins into the hand protruding
from the front seat, and, head
low, he turned and entered the
apartment house.</p>

<p>He trudged dismally up the
stairs, thinking about his wife. He
wondered what would happen if
she were awake and waiting for
him. If she saw that he had on
somebody else's name tag.</p>

<p>The door was unlocked.</p>

<p>And the light was on.</p>

<p>He wondered if he could duck
into the bedroom without being
seen, and then someone leaped at
him and he knew it was too late.</p>

<p>"Oh, James dear!" she cried,
throwing her arms around Charles'
neck. "When you walked out of
here, I thought you'd never come
back to me!"</p>

<p>Charles looked at the marilyn's
name tag with slow horror and
realized that in his preoccupation,
out of sheer force of habit, he had
simply said to the cab driver, "Take
me home," and the driver had
looked at the address on his tag and
complied. The apartment building
so much resembled Charles' own
that he hadn't known the difference,
and he hadn't bothered to
look at the number on the door.</p>

<p>When Charles walked in, this
Marilyn, Stasia her name was, had
looked at his name tag and thought
he was her James. She didn't have
the slightest idea of who he really
was.</p>

<p>Then Charles closed his eyes,
swallowed, and knew something
else.</p>

<p>It really didn't make the least
bit of difference <i>who</i> he was. And
of course, the solution to all his
troubles was obvious.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Charles leaned over
Stasia and kissed her.</p>
